## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vuejs
- Pinia
- Local storage

### What I learned

I enjoyed working in the structure of this projects. Thinking what's the best approach with different components and css, sass files. Also how to work with SVG files.
The benefits of working Flexbox and CSS Grid at the same time it's definitely useful and neccesary.
This project helped to brush up my skills with the different technologies that I use daily. Most of the times my work is based in build components and style them but not to structure a complete project. It was an enjoyable experience since the planning phase until the deployment in Netlify.

### Continued development

I'm going to add unit test files
